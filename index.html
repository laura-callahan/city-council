            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
            <div>The daughter of an Army officer, Laura moved to Colorado in 2013 after growing up in Germany. Since graduating from the University of Denver, she has been working as a software engineer. Laura moved to the City of Sheridan in 2021, and has been an active member of the Planning Commission during her residence. She has also assisted the Roots in Sheridan program with their outreach efforts. Laura has worked with Humane Colorado to curb the spread of disease and cat overpopulation in the community cats with <a href="https://www.alleycat.org/our-work/trap-neuter-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trap, neuter, and release</a> services.

            <h3>Increase housing affordability</h3>
            <div>Sheridan can do more to improve the affordability for renters and buyers. Laura is a proponent of
                allowing residential zoning to meet the needs of the community, encouraging new housing development, and keeping Sheridan's property taxes low.
            </div>

            <h3>Multi-modal safety improvements</h3>
            <div>Laura would like to improve the safety of pedestrians and cyclists and make Sheridan more accessible to people with disabilities, 
                children, and residents on foot. She would work with city planners and constituents to determine best practices for 
                improving safety and ease of use.
            </div>

            <h3>Improve Colorado Department of Transportation relations</h3>
            <div>CDOT policy and mainenance has a more substantial effect on Sheridan than neighboring cities given our proximity to Santa Fe Drive,
                Federal Boulevard, and US Route 285. Because of this, Sheridan needs to collaborate with CDOT to ensure our community is not neglected.
                Current leadership has resisted creating a more formal relationship with CDOT, shutting our community out of the conversation.
            </div>

            <h3>Encouraging business development</h3>
            <div>Many of Sheridan's businesses do not meet the needs of the community. Sheridan should encourage business development efforts that
                focus on how to entice people to spend more time, and thus money, in our neighborhood. This would include 
                beautification initiatives, a focus on recreational businesses, and walkability in new development.
